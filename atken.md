> The work can be presented as both an interactive installation and a number of video works made using the same system. We use a novel training system and custom software, facilitating playful interaction and continuous, meaningful human control [1] in ways that offer a range of potential creative affordances not available in any other system.

> Thus, at a higher level, the motivation behind the work is to use these convolutional artificial neural networks [2] — very loosely inspired by our own visual cortex [3] — as a reflection on our own self-affirming cognitive biases. This is particularly inspired by models of predictive processing and cognition [4], and more specifically, the idea that the “reality” we perceive in our minds is not a mirror image of the outside world, but a reconstruction based on and limited by our physiology, expectations and prior beliefs [5].

Early twentieth-century abstract animators and filmmakers such as Norman McLaren and Oskar Fischinger, analog computer animation pioneer John Whitney Sr. [7] and analog video synthesizers such as the Rutt-Etra are also key influences.
