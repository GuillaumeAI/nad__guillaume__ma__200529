> The emergence of digital technologies allowed artists such as Myron Krueger, David Rokeby, Ed Tannenbaum, Rebecca Allen, Scott Snibbe, Golan Levin and Camille Utterback, to name a few, to work in this subfield of interactive media art, exploring new modes of expression. 

 ## Myron Krueger
 
 > [...] considered to be one of the **first generation virtual reality and augmented reality researchers**.
   
 > He **envisioned the art of interactivity**, as opposed to art that happens to be interactive. That is, the idea that **exploring the space of interactions between humans and computers** was interesting. The focus was on the possibilities of interaction itself, rather than on an art project, which happens to have some response to the user.

> The work can be presented as both an interactive installation and a number of video works made using the same system. We use a novel training system and custom software, facilitating playful interaction and continuous, meaningful human control [1] in ways that offer a range of potential creative affordances not available in any other system.

> Thus, at a higher level, the motivation behind the work is to use these convolutional artificial neural networks [2] — very loosely inspired by our own visual cortex [3] — as a reflection on our own self-affirming cognitive biases. This is particularly inspired by models of predictive processing and cognition [4], and more specifically, the idea that the “reality” we perceive in our minds is not a mirror image of the outside world, but a reconstruction based on and limited by our physiology, expectations and prior beliefs [5].

> The concept of visual instruments can be traced back to Louis-Bertrand Castel’s ocular harpsichord [6] and similar mechanical visual instruments from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Early twentieth-century abstract animators and filmmakers such as Norman McLaren and Oskar Fischinger, analog computer animation pioneer John Whitney Sr. [7] and analog video synthesizers such as the Rutt-Etra are also key influences.
